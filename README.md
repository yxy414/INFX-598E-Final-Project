# INFX-598E-Final-Project
This repo includes the final project for INFX 598 E at the UW.
For this project, working by myself, I will optimize the 'profile' html file that I created for the week 5 assignment in this class.
The goal of this project is to make a real profile page that is ready for job hunting. 


You can access the final project at the following location:
